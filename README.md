# Challenge-9-Note-Taker

This note taker app is extremely user friendly.
<br>
With this app, the user can easily create a title for their notes, create the note, and then save the notes locally.
<br>
If the user chooses to delete the notes later, they can do so by clicking the red trash can button.
